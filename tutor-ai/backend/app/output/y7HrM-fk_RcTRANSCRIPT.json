I am emeritus at Stanford so I'll have that affiliation up there as well so let me start with a show of hands how many people here have a single lens reflex camera an SLR uh-huh okay how many people have a mi L camera mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera okay how many people have a point-and-shoot as their best camera don't you be embarrassed about how many people have a cellphone as their best camera okay looks like it's quite diverse although there were a large number of SLR is in in the room okay so the purpose of this course is first of all how do I use my camera and I think this is probably more sophisticated audience on average then Stanford so we might not need to spend very long getting up to speed there the second is the technology the science and technology behind the camera and that's one of the major focuses of the course so for example if you go to any book on photography it will not have it'll talk about depth of field but it will not have the depth of field formula in it and the formula is not all that hard depth of field equals to n C u squared over F squared where that's the F number the circle of confusion we'll talk about all this later during the course the distance to the subject and the focal length it's just not that hard to formula but you cannot find it in any book I have ever found on photography you have to go to an optics monograph before you can find it let's try to fill that gap and a lot of other similar gaps in in this course so we'll talk for example about sensor noise if you take a very short exposure it's noisy turns out it's called photon shot noise will define that if you put the camera on a tripod and take a very long exposure that will be noisy too but for a different reason it's called dark current and so we'll describe a whole model for noise in the sensor will also talk about color theory so the primaries that you think of in computer graphics are red green and blue the filters on a camera are red green and blue but when you print the inks are cyan magenta and yellow so what's with that and of course the primaries from nursery school are red blue and yellow so and you know that those are the right three primaries right so what is with that so we'll talk about color theory all right we'll also talk about taking good photographs so interspersed with the the technical lectures will be lectures on the history of photography great photographers rules of composition ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_0_180.mp4"}, {"start_time": 180, "end_time": 360, "text": "and there are these optional weekly photographic assignments if you'd like to do them I'll talk more about them in a minute I'll also have little sidebars on computational photography so we do burst mode computational photography on the Nexus phones and we'll will talk about that as well okay so let's just look very briefly at the syllabus so this is going to be done in the style of my course at Stanford it'll be a series of lectures and we'll talk first about the kind of raw materials of photography perspective a little bit of history choosing a camera and then we'll get it will dive in starting next week to the technology and we'll talk first about optics and we'll get pretty deep into and we'll talk about aberration theory and so on but then there's composition more technology will talk about autofocus systems and metering systems and how they work then the second set of two weeks will be about the sensor and photons and bits and pixels and noise and ISO or gain but then some fun stuff in there as well well I'll actually have a guest lecturer come in and talk about night photography and Astro photography it's Jessie Levinson who wrote the Pro HDR app if you know that app then we'll go back into technology again we'll talk about oh I sold bit more history kind of fun why is sports photography hard and what we can do about it using computational photography then we'll go back into theory again we'll talk about color and why Android systems are not color managed and should be and then we'll talk about light and reflection and lighting including flash and then the last part of the course will be about the in-camera image processing and panorama is in a little bit more history so that's that's the layout of the course I'm not going to talk about the logistics all right you you've all seen the website the website has some pointers I have recommended some books are the same ones I use it Stanford it's a great book on photography that does not have the depth of field formula in it this is one of a series of books learning to see creatively by bryan peterson on just making you think in an interesting way so you could have taken a picture like this but look you could have taken this other picture of the same scene i'll show a few examples from that in my lectures then there's this course reader so the course reader has more advanced material they'll be monographs on optics and so on I can't give that out here because at Stanford they've gotten all the copyrights for it I don't have that here but the citations are clear in the schedule and so you can track them down if you want it alright so I'm not expecting any knowledge of photography but so today's lecture in particular ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_180_360.mp4"}, {"start_time": 360, "end_time": 540,

assignments you'll need a camera with manual control over aperture and shutter not focus because there are easy ways to fool that but you will need control over the aperture in the shutter and I think I I'll just dive right into the lecture at that point the we can talk more about the assignments next time if you want to do the assignments just let me have a show of hands there was one assignment on the course website probably you guys looked at it are you thinking of doing the assignments or not raise your hand if you're thinking of doing the assignments okay all right so in that case I assume that this scales to the other 900 people who were not in this room who are signed up for the course we will set up we have a G+ community the G+ community will be a way for you to post albums and we'll come up with a paradigm for commenting on these of each other's albums because obviously I can't do that and I don't have an army of TA is the way I would at Stanford okay so if you want to read along in the textbook the reading for this week is London's book chapters 2 which is on the camera and chapter 13 on the history of photography all right so what we'll talk about first is the raw materials of photography we'll talk about perspective and the laws of perspective as the ancients knew them and then as it was reinvented in the Renaissance we'll talk about image formation with and without lenses and we'll talk about just the elements of exposure so a very very slow introduction there will be not that interesting brag for some of you although I think I have a few interesting facts about these things that you they may surprise you to bring everyone up to speed I'll talk about choosing a camera I don't know how far we'll get today well whoops have to see okay so laws of perspective so they start with two common assumptions that the ancients would have known one that light leaving an object travels in a straight line so they could have easily figured that out by having the candle an object and the shadow and noting that they're all three in a straight line now that seems obvious to you but somebody had to actually observe that okay the second rule is that light converges to a point at the eye and that's how you see again kind of obvious to you but the ancients would have had to observe this first and they could easily observe ", "video_path":

between my eye and the finger and that and I can block you out like this and those converge at the eye okay so here's where it begins to get interesting there is natural perspective and linear perspective so natural perspective is what the ancients knew it's in Euclid's book on optics and he says more distant objects subtend smaller visual angles and so you'll actually find in Euclid's books something that looks like this so he'll say given two objects this one and this one being viewed from there there'll be a certain angle between them theta one and then he'll say suppose that the objects move closer to the eye like this or that the eye moves closer to the to the scene then it will be this situation with a different angle theta so - and that theta sub two will always be greater than theta sub one if the objects move toward the eye very simple more distant objects subtends smaller visual angles so think of the angle like this for those converging rays alright so that's pretty straightforward how good a drawing or painting could the ancients make with this knowledge so not too many drawings come down to us from ancient times these do because they're either in Pompeii or Herculaneum and you know what happened to those towns so what do you think about these drawings they look like they have the right perspective yell out some opinion what do you what do you think what do you see in these drawings they're a little flat what why they drink more aggressively so what you're saying is that this these things get smaller but they don't seem to get smaller at the right rate okay anybody else I agree with that anybody else what else do you see right yeah the shading looks a little funny look at look at this thing what do you think of that top of that it's wrong and look at this this was presumably a circular pavilion and it doesn't seem like it's quite the right shape so they knew that things got smaller as they got ", "video_path":

that rule I just gave you on natural perspective is not sufficient to make a correct drawing that requires linear perspective so linear perspective was the invention of filippo brunelleschi and what he said was the following let's say you have the same scene and the eye that you would interpose a picture plane which represents the canvas on which you're drawing and you would project those objects back through the picture plane and you'd end up with some distance between them why one and then if the objects moved closer just as I showed before we'll have them move closer by the same amount as I did up here and look at that and project that onto the picture plane that those will have a distance between them of y2 and y2 will be more than y1 if the objects are moving closer to you but how much theta 2 is greater than theta 1 in the natural perspective case is not equal to how much Y 2 is greater than Y 1 in other words these are two different perspective systems and it makes the drawing look different and that projection onto a picture plane which represented the drawing surface is linear perspective so here's the comparison again so we could actually derive this precisely let's say that we wanted to make a projection and let's call this the height of some object and this the distance away from the eye and we'd like to make a projection onto that plane this so called picture plane and we'd like to compute Y which is this so it's obvious by similar triangles that H over Z H over Z equals y over and I need to ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_720_900.mp4"}, {"start_time": 900, "end_time": 1080, "text": "define this distance and let's call that F okay and so if I solve for y y equals H F over Z so it's fairly easy in the Renaissance included to be able to compute exactly where you should make each of these points on a drawing or painting notice also that that projection involves a division by Z which means that how big things will appear on the picture plane is inversely proportional to their distance from the eye that's a very crisp rule you double the distance of an object it will get half as big on a linear perspective which includes cameras okay so by the way you will have to put up in this class with the fact that I am trained as an architect and so I can't help but point out that Philippa Brunelleschi actually made a revolution in two fields not only linear perspective but also Renaissance architecture and he put the dome the dome on the Duomo in Florence which is a great story I don't have time to tell all right so before Philippa Brunelleschi this is how perspective drawings were being made in the Middle Ages and you don't have to look very hard at this to realize that there's really a lot of things wrong with this drawing these tie these pave meant though the pavement does get smaller toward the back but doesn't get smaller fast enough something's wrong and the these lines converge kind of in this direction these converge in this direction these converge they don't all converge to a single point it's just all messed up what they're converging to so Philippa Brunelleschi did not write down his methods but Leon Battista Alberti I architect from the Renaissance did and so here's Albert he's retelling of Brunelleschi's rules for linear perspective he said you want to make a painting here's how you go about it you start here's your canvas and let's say you want to made it make a painting of these puppy meant though the pavement squares and so you lay out on the ground and the even kick of pavements choose a vanishing point which lines up with your eye so it's as tall as you are and then draw these things called orthogonals okay that's step one and everything that goes away from you should go to that point then here's the one that's slightly trickier here's a side view here's the painting now here's that plane at least in theory there are you don't have to actually do this layout the tick marks that go away from you in ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_900_1080.mp4"}, {"start_time": 1080, "end_time": 1260, "text": "space on the floor so there are paper construction techniques for doing that on a painting that you learn in architecture school and then draw those back through the picture plane and compute where they intersect and then those make the so-called transversals which are these lines here and because straight lines remain straight in a linear perspective you can do a diagonal line and it should stay straight and the division by Z is apparent here because pavement marks that are twice as far as others will be half as big and lengthened with so this simple rule was enough to revolutionize art in the 1500s in the fifteenth century and so we have karo della Francesca doing a painting called the flagellation which has these marvellous accurate linear perspective depictions of various pavement patterns he's clearly showing off here as a matter of fact the 3d model is so good that you that scholars have been able to determine that there is a light source shining on Jesus that is not shining on anybody else and they can say exactly where that light source a is and in fact the model is so good that I had a student in the course that could take just that painting there's the painting and make a 3d computer model from the painting she had to make some assumptions about field of view but those are not hard assumptions to make and then using that she connection planner this has been done actually with a lot of pages darn good for a freshman okay she's now PhD student at Princeton by the way okay so there are lots of ways of talking about perspective some of them are relevant for photography so let's let's play a bit with the laws of perspective so if you're looking straight at some architectural scene so if I take a camera and I just look straight at the back wall and the back wall is curved I'll look I'll look at that wall so what I'll see is that some lines will converge to a single point but the verticals are still vertical and the horizontal ZAR still horizontal that's called a one-point perspective if I take and there's a picture plane in here which we'll talk about in a moment if I take this picture plane and rotate ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_1080_1260.mp4"}, {"start_time": 1260, "end_time":

two-point perspective the verticals are still vertical if I take the Renaissance canvas or this the center plane and the camera and tip it up or tip it down then it's sort of like this drawing and the verticals now begin to converge okay quiz question how many vanishing points can there be in perspective drawing so I've shown one two and three point perspectives what do you think three the limit I see someone say yep three is it where we live in a three-dimensional world three is the limit any other opinions in the back Florian I'm going to prohibit Florian from answering any questions these are ringer but yes that's exactly right so here's actually there probably a lot of professional level photographers taking this course so I should pick on Florian so suppose you have a cube like this they're three vanishing points shown but now consider the diagonals of the cube those lines there if you follow those that leads to another vanishing point in fact the rule is each direction a parallel line will converge to its own unique vanishing point so the answer is an infinite number depending on the number of directions of parallel lines okay let's try something else should the distant ends of a long facade be drawn smaller than the center so it's a question I usually ask at Stanford and I say imagine that you're holding a camera in front of Menchu Memorial Church and there's this RK that goes away on both sides and it's very very long arcade and I stand facing Memorial Church well the ends of that arcade be smaller in my Renaissance painting or in my photograph then the arches that are right near the center what do you think it's really long arcade okay yes it seems to make some intuitive sense they ought to get smaller horizontal become horizontal well so if horizontal stay horizontal then they're not gonna get smaller they're going to be huge they're gonna stay the same size right so how can they stay the same size though what I mean if the thing we're like a mile long with you'd have these enormous arches at the edge of your painting what's going on there so ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_1260_1440.mp4"}, {"start_time": 1440,

can I have a volunteer from the audience someone to come up here and do something my new Googlers all right come on up so we're going to go back to the Renaissance and we're going to reconstruct Albrecht Durer's drawing machine so I'm not going to use the back of the rim which is curved but here's your eye point here's your quill pen and look at that rectilinear set of structures on the outside of the room and draw what you say looking through here I would have to ask for artistic talent okay so while he's doing this this piece of plexiglass is not as long as the long facade would be but think about the principles of what he's doing imagine these lines going out in space so what do you think would be the answer now to this facade problem suppose that the walls of the room notice I place this perpendicular this glass is parallel to that wall of the room suppose that wall of the room went out for half a mile so here's what he here's what he drew see that so what do you think what's that no it's not though I mean imagine imagine that a line through all the column castles the tops of the vertical columns that forms and a plane connecting that in your eye and then intersecting that playing with a picture plane that would definitely make a line yeah oh yeah next they're going to be lighter they won't actually either because of similar triangles it's really non-intuitive but so what happens is they don't get any smaller if there's a set of arches they will be regularly spaced on this no matter how big this is but now suppose we made such drawing and this so this is a huge 20-foot piece of plexiglass made of Renaissance painting out of it hung it in the museum and stood and looked at the painting when we look at the painting the arches on the side of the arcade will be small to us ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_1440_1620.mp4"}, {"start_time": 1620, "end_time": 1800, "text": "because of natural perspective now there was able to subdue look at the painting and that is the key so linear perspective straight lines really do remain straight there's no other way to draw this when you're looking perpendicular to it then like that they appear smaller when you view the drawing due to natural perspective which of the angles subtended at the eye so in fact both linear perspective and natural perspective are in play when you take a photograph or make a drawing and view that drawing so one more quiz and then I'll stop torturing you why does this prospective drawing look distorted the columns look kind of weird at the edges don't they so anybody who has a nexus 6p or 5x knows this distortion so the answer is it's not distorted it's a correct linear perspective you can see the the construction up there there's the picture plane here's the here's the viewpoint and those lines are intersected with it and then just drop down to make this the key is you're not viewing destroying from this distance away from the columns and that's what makes it look distorted you're not viewing it from the intended viewpoint so if I take a picture of you guys with this Nexus 6p it's a fairly wide angle camera 78 degrees and then I look at picture like this my angle on this phone is nowhere near 78 degrees in order for this to appear undistorted I would have to get up to my laptop like this or up to the phone like this and that that difference between the the the angle of view when taking and when viewing is something you have to think about in photography all right question right so if this were my science of art lecture at Stanford I could go into a lot of examples from the art world about how you artists dealt with it you have to be careful what lenses you choose in what you're seeing composition is and if you used a Nexus phone and put people's faces near the edges of the frame that's going to happen so it has to be done through clever composition to avoid those distortions all right so we've talked about natural perspective we talked about linear perspective and we've talked about vanishing points any burning questions so far all right sure no burning questions yes all back on the what we just talked about so

can't actually that's a good question you can't if you compress the outsides and compress the top and bottom in some nonlinear way straight lines will no longer remain straight the verticals in horizontals will but the diagonals will not they'll begin the curve that's gonna look kind of funny it looked like a fisheye yeah yeah we thought about that for the Nexus 6p no no wait that doesn't work straight lines won't remain straight okay let's go on let's talk about lenses and how images are formed so here's an old single lens reflex camera it's a film camera but the general architectures hasn't changed and it's a nice cutaway view and so let's talk about what's inside that so first obvious question is look at these all this glass here do cameras need lenses you know what happens if you just take a sensor and put it up to the world okay so this is nice drawing in you're in in the textbook that talks about that and the way I would prefer to see it is not exactly the way London is drawn NIT but I would run the lines the other way and say each point on the sensor so here's the sensor over here is an integral of everything that it sees in the world and if I take another integral on another point on the sensor it sees almost the same set of stuff so adjacent points on the sensor will not differ from one another by very much that will make a very blurry image so that doesn't work so since ancient times it's been known that you could use a pinhole to solve that problem and in fact make an image on a dark plane somewhere and it's called a pinhole camera or a camera obscura and so there's a little pin hole in a wall and there's the drawing so this is the same thing that a camera does and so it's useful to note that similarity so what's going on over there is this picture plane pinhole and some scene out here and the lines go through that and each point on the object is recorded by one point on the sensor or the just the white plane here and so that makes a perspective drawing this camera will and here's the view point so a camera will have let's say let's talk about pinhole camera first or just a linear perspective ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_1800_1980.mp4"}, {"start_time": 1980, "end_time": 2160, "text": "so here's Brunelleschi's linear perspective he'll have the picture plane here that's the same thing so a pinhole camera is doing a linear perspective the only difference is this might be smaller and it might be a bird or will be inverted but otherwise it is the same it's going to be a linear perspective and both of these are called right tilting I should have said tilting the plane will change that linear perspective just the way we did when we took the camera and we rotated it and the vanishing points came and went these are called 2d planar geometric projections the definition is it's a projection along lines through a point onto a plane okay so you can do this and make photography so there's a great book called pinhole photography that does that and straight lines will remain straight so I know it doesn't look like that because it's just funny curve building but that's actually that building is curved to New York City but look at this building and look at the bicycle spokes and so straight lines remain straight another thing that happens when you have a pinhole is that everything is in focus because only one ray from the object turns to one ray to one point on the picture plane what's that oh and now you mean the fact that it's monochrome uh well depends how you're recording it I mean you get put a color film here it'll be in color okay that's a second-order effect which we'll talk about next week yeah actually you'll have diffraction as well if the pinhole is too small we will talk about that as well next week okay so London says this he's got this nice drawing and he says suppose we had a slightly larger pinhole because one of the problems of a pinhole is it admits very little light and if the panel is really small it will creat diffraction artifacts as well okay I again prefer to run the Rays the other way and to say that every point on the sensor and now he's got the sensor on the right here is looking at an integral over some small region on the scene and we'll make essentially a blur of the scene that way so for that reason we don't use pinholes even large pinholes in photography but a lens does the same thing a lens takes all the Rays leaving in fact one very small point and brings them back together here and so it gathers a lot of light and it still makes a linear perspective so if we look at the pinhole there's the view point and if we look at the lens it is the middle ray and that will become more ", "video_path":

of the lens and so it's also a 2d planar geometric projection and if you rotate this sensor and it turns out you have to rotate the lens as well which is what happens when I just rotate the camera then vanishing points will come and go even though I'm not using a pinhole even though I'm using a lens okay so let's take a gentle step into geometrical optics I will do this more rigorously with derivations next week but it can be introduced fairly gently and all you need to understand how it lens makes a focused image is two simple rules one that parallel rays entering this doubly curved piece of glass will converge more or less to a single point and that single point is some distance away by convention we call that the focal length of the lens the second thing you need to know is that rays that go through the middle rather than striking the edge don't deviate they actually do deviate slightly we'll talk about the thin lens approximation next week so those two rules are enough to make a construction you may have seen in senior year of high school called Gauss's ray construction so let's do that here so that line in the middle is called the optical axis here's the lens and first let's use the first rule which are that parallel rays will go through a point at some distance away from the lens called F focal length of the lens and let's say we have an object out here and rays that are they go through the middle continue uninterrupted these eventually intersect here and all other points along this object will come together at similar points here and make an image that image will be upside down might be a different size but it will be a correct linear perspective you can think about just this ray as being the one denoting that linear perspective with the center of projection right view point right there so here is Gauss's construction rays coming from points on a plane parallel to the lens our focus two points on another plane parallel to the lens on the other side and flipped so that very simple rule gets us pretty far we'll derive this next Monday but for now let's just ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_2160_2340.mp4"}, {"start_time": 2340, "end_time": 2520, "text": "assume that construction and let's see what the effects of it are on photography so first of all what happens if we change the distance between the lens and the sensor so we have a lens whose focal length the length at which parallel rays come together is F and we start moving the sensor relative to that what begins to happen is that instead of parallel rays coming to a point rays that come from some finite distance come to a point instead now exactly what that relationship is is called the Gaussian lens formula we will do that on next Monday but so for now just take it on faith that the Gauss's lens construction can be modified to do that in addition so that's called focusing a camera so typically we don't actually move the sensor we move the lens and so on this 50 millimeter prime which has no zoom it's just a fixed focal length lens if I move and how many of you can see it but if I move this ring the lens actually moves in and out so it's changing the distance between the lens and the sensor and that's doing exactly this and so that means that points at different distances will be in focus right so the focus distance is by convention called on the object side of lens all right let's distinguish this focus distance from the focal length of the lens focal length of the lens is a characteristic of the lens itself how quickly does it bend light how quickly to those parallel rays come together to a point so if we go from a normal lens to a telephoto lens a lens intended to look at wildlife it's we think of it as a stronger lens it's actually weaker lens in the sense that it's less curved pieces of glass in there and they bend the light less and so takes them a longer time for parallel rays to come together and that's what's shown in this diagram here so here's a lens with a 3-inch focal length so these aren't quite parallel rays Kings Lake which is a classic book on photography move the tree in a little bit from infinity but you can think about these as being roughly parallel they come together after what does he say three inches there and he uses a weaker lens lens with less curvature on both sides and will drive how the curvature actually affects that next week so it comes to a focus after six inches so that's a that's a telephoto lens so actually if you look closely that diagram the tree is slightly beyond the focal length of the lens because this is not at infinity that it's actually by ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_2340_2520.mp4"}, {"start_time": 2520, "end_time": 2700, "text": "fractions of an inch if you work it out but those factors of an inch are important that's called a Gaussian lens formula we'll do that next Monday the tree would be in focus at this distance rather than this distance only if it were infinitely far away so that's the difference between these two okay so let's play with this drawing a little bit so there's a sensor suppose we take the same size sensor and stick it in this other camera or change the lens on the camera fairly obviously it's going to have a narrower field of view you have a longer focal length you use the same size sensor it's going to have a smaller field of view it's going to see less of the tree and you can the math for it is really simple it's an angle and you've got the height of the sensor and the focal length and it's just a little bit of trig so from that simple formula there's a great set of images in London's book that says all right for 17 millimeter lens the diagonal field of view is 104 degrees and then it goes through a bunch of them so that's obviously super wide angle this 28 millimeter that's roughly equivalent to your Nexus 6p or 5x it's roughly 28 millimeter gets narrower angle narrower angle or more telephoto and so on until we just see the details on the bridge of the ship okay and here are the corresponding millimeters so this is for a 35-millimeter full-frame camera if you had a different camera well let's see what would happen if you had a different camera so let's talk about changing the sensor size so here's the drawing I just had now let's bring in so that's a theta fo v1 let's bring in a smaller sensor over here okay so there's a smaller sensor and it's going to have a smaller field of view but if you have the same focal length so the sensor is smaller the field of view is smaller - smaller sensors either have smaller pixels or fewer of them and they'll be noisier and we'll talk about that later in the course so since your size and focal lengths interplay and it's important to understand that interplay so here's a depiction of some common sensor sizes here a bunch of cameras and so I have those cameras here here's the full-frame camera 24 by 36 millimeter sensor the same size sensor that's actually behind that mirror there but if I I'm not supposed to do this that's supposed to open a camera like this and leave it open I've got it set for half a second exposure you'll see the mirror flip out of the way and you'll see that half that 24 by 36 millimeter sensor it's it's back there it's big so that's a full frame camera aps-c is a very common prosumer or Cir consumer digital camera it's got a ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_2520_2700.mp4"}, {"start_time": 2700, "end_time": 2880, "text": "slightly smaller sensor it's in the case of this particular one the Nikon 3100 it's fifteen point five times twenty three point seven so the ratio between those sizes and the full-frame is called the crop factor so the width of a full-frame sensor over the width of this sensor of the camera you're talking about and so for the the Nikon 3100 it's a 1.5 X crop factor that's called aps-c to go into a photography sword and say aps-c they'll say Oh which brand another common format is Micro Four Thirds which has a crop factor of two and so here's an example of a Micro Four Thirds camera this Olympus om-d e-m1 it up that sensor is exactly half the size half the width half the height of the full-frame one that I just showed it also doesn't have a mirror we'll talk about that in a moment oh um it's pretty close that's why this is a little Kilda there you'll see tears on a lot of my slides oh well that's a different question yes the horizons in our gravity controlled world are horizontal and so that's why it is wider than it is high crop factor could be anything doesn't need to be 2x so now you have to think carefully about the focal lengths so because the sensor size and the focal length interacting the way I showed you on the previous slide you have to take the focal lengths that you read off the lens and multiply it by the crop factor when you're talking to someone else who may not know what size sensor you have on your camera so this zoom lens here says 18 millimeter focal length up to a 55 millimeter focal length so that's the Nikon 3100 you've got to multiply that by 1.5 to get twenty eight to eighty roughly focal length and so say for the micro four-thirds you have to multiply it by two okay so here's a point shoot camera this is the only point shoot camera frankly that I would buy at this point is the Sony rx100 because it's got a pretty big sensor it's only a crop factor of 2.7 where's most other point shoots these days are a lot smaller than that pretty nice point shoot camera question right I'll show you that a second so alright so you multiply the focal length by the crop factors there's the point shoot here's an iPhone 6s there's the size of its sensor and there's the Nexus 6p a little bit bigger

let's see 636 so it's about a factor of six it's about a crop factor of six relative to a full-frame camera okay but you can take pretty good pictures using there's a great website about this by the way you can take pretty good pictures even with a Micro Four Thirds camera so here is a picture I took in Paris with a Micro Four Thirds camera this is the panasonic g f1 and like a 90 millimeter lens so it's very nice lens but the sensor is big enough even though it's at night I think this was a handheld shot or maybe I propped it on a car you can take pretty good pictures with Micro with the smaller formats ok let's talk about changing the focal length versus changing where you stand because that's an important principle in photography and here's a an illustration from King's like where the scene isn't changing moving her head a little bit but she's she and the guy are standing in the same place but as you move yourself back and go to a telephoto a more telephoto view she stays about the same size but he gets bigger because he's farther away so that's what the Telep that's what the narrower feels of you tend to do they flatten the scene they make stuff that's far away and stuff that's close seem similar sizes even when they're not so it changes the perspective relationships it isn't changing what blocks what so the occlusion relationships in the scenes stay the same but the size relationships change and in fact if you're really really careful you can move forward while shortening the focal length and keep objects with one particular depth exactly the same size and so that's shown in this diagram so this guy could move forward from here to here to here while changing from a 135 millimeter focal length lens to a 24 millimeter more wide-angle focal length lens and you look at the construction here you'll see all those lines intersect at this plane here that means objects at that plane would exactly fill the field of view and would not change size and that is called the dolly zoom and it's used in cinematography it was pioneered or shown to great effect by Alfred Hitchcock's movie vertigo and so there's Jimmy Stewart climbing the staircase and and when he gets to the mid-level watch this zoom right now that's a dolly zoom he's gonna do it again look at his hands his hands don't move that frame stays the same but the ", "video_path":

you get the idea there all right so this idea that perspective relationships change has a strong effect on portraits in particular so a wide-angle portrait or a nexus 6p or 5x phone makes big noses and that's because the nose sticks out further from the rest of the face and has this unusual perspective relationship if I stood up very close to the image and let that and it would be fine but I don't usually view the image from that close and so she gets a big nose standard may have been about I'm not sure in this set of illustrations 50 and this may have been more like 85 millimeters and the standard portrait lens photographers wisdom is about 85 millimeter so again if your sensor smaller you have to multiply by the crop factor to get numbers that are comparable to the numbers I'm talking about okay so to recap this part pinhole cameras lenses and we talked about the focus distance and the focal length focus distance is how far the lens is from the sensor the focus distance is a property of the optics itself and depends on sensor size any burning questions here yes so go back the previous slide portraits so if I'm I said I just happen to have my my cell phone and I want to take a portrait so what is the solution for me what should I do to optimize the portrait I have your subject stand but for the back so I should see in a crop do right crop which is the same as a pinch zoom that's right it's bad all you can do it'll lose you some spatial resolution you can buy one of his little clip on lenses but yes question about how far away the subject is that you're focusing on like I haven't want to be able to tell in story where are you doing like an establishing shot that's like far away or you like doing a close-up shot and I'm trying to think of can you can you multiply something to tell you you know what where would the lines of converged yeah look the look on underspecified anymore you look at the EXIF data that's in the JPEG file I'll tell you the focal length in many cameras they do include the focus distance if it's a focusable camera but i don't think that i'm circumventing your question it's a computer vision problem and you need to know something about the scene you need a calibrated object in the scene and if you computer going to figure that out or you need multiple views at the same question question mark so uh for let's say microphones cameras

that's right you yes it will but different objects that are at different distances will convert those lines will converge to the sensor so something in a different distance will be in focus maybe not the parallel lines will be in focus which is why you focus okay so this whole course don't be afraid to ask these kinds of questions this whole course is going to be about very very simple formulas that lead to surprisingly complex relationships when you begin to consider multiple of them and that's what makes photography interesting is these complex relationships between simple concepts okay I'm looking at my Dory I don't see any questions feel free remote audience to ask questions on the dory I think the Dory is working ok so let's go on and let's talk about exposure okay so I don't like this formula because it's got kind of wrong letters in it but it's the standard formula it says exposure which is H is irradiance which is e I'm sorry I make this up times time so Arabians is the amount of light falling on a unit area of the sensor per second so I'll actually give it units later on in the course we'll talk about lumens per meter squared but for now just think about it as light per unit area falling on the sensor it's controlled by the aperture talk about that in a moment and then exposure time is seconds controlled by the shutter so those are two the two critical variables for controlling the exposure of your picture so if we look back at our single end reflex camera there is a mirror in there and you saw when I took a picture the mirror flipped out of the way the light went to the film which is now replaced by a digital sensor and then there is this aperture here which can close and open that's that's where the app numbers come from which will define a moment they're typically right in the middle of a bunch of lenses that are kind of symmetrical on both sides we'll talk about that next week and then there's a shutter and we'll talk about the shutter right now and where the shutter goes of some gratuitous animation of the shutter opening and closing okay so there are two kinds of shutters there is a leaf shutter which is in the middle of the lens actually unlike the previous picture which showed the other kind of shutter that I'll talk about in a moment so this isn't just historical if you go ", "video_path":

some of those things in class in a few weeks these are still very much used to get tilt-shift effects and and so on the shutter will typically be in the middle of the lens so that has a few characteristics it's typically a quiet shutter it's kind of slow because it's a bunch of leaves that open and close so you can't get very fast shutter speeds that way it's out of focus something here is not at the focal length for any no matter what the object distance is and so if it opens and closes slowly you'll never see a picture of that on your image and if it is slow to open slow to close there'd be a little bit less light that gets to your image from the outer parts but it's not the outer parts of your image it's the outer parts of your aperture so it actually doesn't matter and so these were the first historically to be developed you need one per lens because you if you exchange the lens that's built into the middle of the lens modern cameras don't use those except for these view cameras they use what's called a focal plane shutter so focal plane shutter is two rectangles that either do this like that so my sensor my eyes are the sensor this and this over they'll open a little bit and then move that slit across if they want to get a really short shutter time so those are loud so it's kind of hard to show you what it sounds like because these things have a mirror in them the mirror flips out of the way and that's much louder but the Micro Four Thirds cameras don't have the mirror they have an electronic viewfinder instead so what you see on the back when it's running is just an electronic viewfinder you can't hold it up and look through it so there's no mirror that directs light up into the viewfinder and so if I take the back off of this and hold a microphone up we can hear it's or I've set it to one second exposure ready Oh No let me try turning on the mic ready huh now that sounded kind of weird it did like several things there it's really quite complicated in these mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras because right now the shutter is open why well because the light has to reach the sensor so you can see something on the viewfinder because there's no optical viewfinder as there is on these things there's no bump on the top so when you press the shutter first have to close that get ready to take a picture open it close it really quickly to take the picture and then open it again to resume your viewfinder so the viewfinder stops watch see the viewfinder went dark then it came back ", "video_path":

interchangeable-lens camera quickly close up my sensor so I don't get dust on it all right so they're fast because you can make that slit really really small as it moves across it doesn't need to move across in a 4,000 second just has to be narrow enough so the effective exposure is as if it opened and closed in a four thousand of a second it's in focus it's at the same plane as the film so it's got to move really fast so you don't see less light in some place than in others it also distorts motion because in the case of a slit like this not all to the scene are being exposed at the same time and so there are lots of famous photographs cool video by the way of showing these in action by the way all these slides will be available as a PDF so I know Spielberg can't pick up this height a little bit next but you can look at the PDF you can find the link and you can go look at this really cool slow-mo video of the shutter all right this is a very famous photograph from the early 20th century it's focal-plane shutter which direction is the shutter moving don't put three out of the four I should just leave this as hork so what's happening here is the photographer is trying to pan with the car and the shutter must be moving from bottom to top relative to the image so when the photographer pans that makes the people go that way cuz they're stationary and if he upend that exactly the same rate as the car it would look normal in quite match the speed of the car so it actually looks tilted the other way now that's relative to the picture actually the lens flips the image so inside the camera would have been taught the bottom so homework assignment for you guys if you have an SLR try to figure out what direction you're without opening up the camera what direction your shutter moves you'll actually have a hard time even opening up the camera unless you use another camera to take a picture of it in slow-mo because they move really fast alright so shutter speed

"pixels saturate meaning they fill up with light and they can't store anymore light that's called saturation we'll talk about that when we talk about noise models and sensors later on in the course it's denoted in fractions of a second typically a doubling scale be full abundant that's historical just means it's open until you release the shutter we can handle the camera down to about a sixtieth of a second so a slightly more accurate formula is to say the shortest exposure is 1 over the focal length so I have a electron stabilization where we'll derive that geometric light for now let me just state that that if you go to a telephoto lens you better take a shorter exposure so one hundred and eightieth of a second one second 182 a second for 180 millimeter lens and so for example and you have to use the 35 millimeter equivalent so that shot that I showed you before in Paris was an 90 millimeter lens on a 2x crop sensor it was this Micro Four Thirds camera and so I would have to multiply 90 by to get 180 so I should take the picture without 180 at 2nd of a second if I'm going to handhold it question what's it um yeah and why have I been teaching this course for six years and no one has pointed that out before thank you if you see an error in my sides believe let me know right oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I won't fix that okay the main side effect of shutter speed is motion blur so doubling the exposure time or having the shutter speed will double the motion blur okay that's that's pretty straightforward useful shutter speeds I was extremely lucky I probably had a stabilized

she's doing a radial thing so uh either direction of I think it's going up I have to work it out oh is that oh you're asking question yeah let's see so let me first bring everyone up to speed so one thing I didn't talk about is electronic shutters so the point-and-shoot cameras sometimes have a mechanical shutter like the kind of described and sometimes do not cell phones do not they do not have a mechanical shutter so instead what they'll do is they'll reset all the pixels at once erase all the pixels and then start integrating time and then they'll read out the pixels or sorry they won't they won't reset them all at once so we set them going from let's say top to bottom and a little while later they'll read them out going from top to bottom and then we set them again and then read them out again that's called a rolling shutter and so that's a typical electronic shutter because they can't read it all at once there are some sensor architectures that can do that but most mounted cameras have this so-called electronic rolling shutter and so video has done that way as well so your question was Nikon had electronics so any of these cameras could have an electronic shutter like that and it could either shift everything into a masked area at once or more typically these days it does this electronic rolling shutter does that answer your question so I I will check after class but I think the right answer is that these architectures that have a masked area into which they can move the charges per pixel take a little bit of area and reduce the efficiency of the sensor as a whole and there may be other electronic reasons I will check but I think that's the right answer all right so another question yeah I'm the what sorry the electronic shutter right right so well in

same thing Micro Four Thirds camera does close the shutter we open it close it again and reopen it again just like a Micro Four Thirds camera right okay okay so let's talk now about aperture so aperture is a little bit more complicated because there are a couple of variables here first the irradiance on the sensor so we irradiance is the amount of light per unit time per unit area on the sensor is proportional to the square of the diameter of the aperture and so the way to think about it is they use a for this even though a would like to be area again I didn't responsible for this and of course the area is PI a over two squared and so the amount of light that gets through goes is the square of the diameter of the aperture okay it also goes is the inverse square of the distance to the sent to the sensor the way to think about that is let's look at a lens and treat it as a bunch of little pinholes so let's just take one of those pinholes there's the optical axis and the design of the lens means that it sees some set of rays so some set of light coming in and distributes those out into the body of the camera so if we put a sensor here it'll have a certain irradiance certain amount of light falling per unit area let's say that that's F if we change the characteristics of the lens make it a little bit shallower twice the focal length so that would be say out here so this is 2f the same set of rays falls on this sensor that's now twice as tall and twice as wide so four ", "video_path": "app/videoData/y7HrM-fk_Rc_4140_4320.mp4"}, {"start_time": 4320, "end_time": 4500,

it goes as two different variables but I just want one number so that I can put a nice dial on my on my camera and so because of that photographers have invented this number called the aperture number which is F over a F over a that factors that out so that you can now talk about n is just being the amount of light the amount of irradiance per unit area on the sensor so you can say that a 50 millimeter lens so this is let's say 25 millimeters and this is 50 millimeters the ratio then is going to be 50 over 25 which is 2 and it's written like this F 2 and that could be the same as a more telephoto lens which has twice the aperture diameter and [Music] twice the focal length so f there would be 100 and 100 over 50 will also be up to so they're both F and F two lens and in fact you can look at ordinary cameras and you can do that so let's see this 90 millimeter here is an F it's actually enough to but I'm going to set it to F 2.8 so here's a 90 millimeter F 2.8 so 90 over 2.8 says it should be about a thirty two millimeter and we can actually take ruler and we can measure that set down like that and it's about thirty millimeters what I see you can't really measure it like this you have to go inside the lens but it's pretty close or I can take this really big lens it's also an F 2.8 lens it's 300 millimeter 2.8 lens and say let's see 300 over 2.8 is 107 so take my ruler 105
